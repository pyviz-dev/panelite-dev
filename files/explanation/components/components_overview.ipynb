    "# Components Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel is a library that provides a lot of object types and while building an app, even a simple one, you will create and interact with many of them. Compare this for instance to the Pandas library, with which you'll normally interact with just a few object types (e.g. `Series`, `DataFrame`). It is important for you to understand the differences between the objects Panel offers and how you can use them.\n",

    "The main objects that Panel provides, and that we are going to call *components* hereafter, short for *visual components*, include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Widgets*: widgets are components, usually quite small even if there are exceptions, that allow your users to interact with your app. Most importantly, they allow you to get user input! Examples include a text input, a checkbox, a slider, etc.\n",
    "- *Panes*: panes are wrappers around some data that allow you to render that data, possibly customizing the rendering. Panel is known to support many date types, especially from the PyData ecosystem. You can indeed display a Pandas DataFrame, a Plotly plot, a Matplotlib plot, an Altair plot, all together on the same app! You can of course display HTML text or just raw text. Panes aren't limited to rendering data statically, they can allow for some user interactions and state syncing, like for instance the `Audio` or `Vega` panes.\n",
    "- *Indicators*: indicators are useful to display some static state, they are indeed implemented as widgets that you can only control programmatically. You'll find for instance a progress indicator or a tooltip.\n",
    "- *Layouts*: after having built various widgets, panes and indicators, it's time to display them together. Panel provides a dozen of layout components, including of course the most common `Row` and `Column` layouts.\n",
    "- *Templates*: templates are components that render multiple Panel objects in an HTML document. The basic template, which you get when you serve an app without setting any template, is basically a blank canvas. Instead when you use one of the built-in templates you can easily improve the design and branding of your app, which will get for free a header, a sidebar, etc.\n",
    "- *Notifications*: notifications are components that display so called \"toasts\", designed to mimic the push notifications that have been popularized by mobile and desktop operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the Panel components can be visualized on the [Component Gallery](../../reference/index.md).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Parameterized components\n",
    "\n",
    "All components in Panel are built on the [Param](https://param.holoviz.org/) library. Each component declares a set of *Parameters* that control the behavior and output of the component. The basic idea however is that the *Parameter* values can be controlled both at the class-level:\n",

    "More than 50 different widgets are available in the `pn.widgets` subpackage, varying from a simple text input to a more complex chat bot.

Take for example a `MultiSelect` widget whose `value` is a `list`. If you programmatically update that list directly, with for example `append` or `extend`, Panel will not be able to detect that change. In which case you need to explicitly trigger updates with `w_multiselect.param.trigger('value')` that will run all the same underlying machinery as if you were setting the *Parameter* to a new value. A notable widget that holds a multable datastructure is the `Tabulator` widget whose `value` is a Pandas DataFrame that can be updated inplace with e.g. `df.loc[0, 'A'] = new_value`, its `patch` method allows to both update the data and the user interface.\n",

These methods make it possible to interactively configure and modify an arrangement of plots, making them an extremely powerful tool for building apps or dashboards.\n",
    "- The `GridSpec` and `GridStack` layout is quite different from the other layout types in that it isn’t list-like. Instead it behaves more like a 2D array that automatically expands when assigned to. This property makes it a very powerful means of declaring a dashboard layout with either a fixed size or with responsive sizing, i.e. one that will rescale with the browser window.\n",
    "\n",

    "When developing an app, someone (possibly you!) will require at some point to make it prettier! A quick way to achieve that is to wrap your app in one of the templates that Panel provides, that are defined by declaring four main content areas on the page, which can be populated as desired:\n",

Unlike other layout components however, the contents of the areas is fixed once rendered.
